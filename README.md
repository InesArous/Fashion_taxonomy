# Fashion Brain taxonomy
EU project 732328: "Fashion Brain".
D1.3: Fashion Brain Taxonomy

In order to better analyze the accuracy of the taxonomy, we created a visualization of the obtained Fashion Brain taxonomy.

The taxonomy we build contains 671 classes ordered hierarchically.

In order to visualize it, we use one of the hypertree tools offered by “JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit”.
With this animation, we can navigate throughout the taxonomy. For example, by clicking on a node, the tree moves, center that node and displays the centered node's children.

In order to see the FashionBrain taxonomy, first clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/InesArous/Fashion_taxonomy.git

then open the following html file:
./Visualisation/Fashion_vis.html

The input data used for this visualization is under the following folder:
./Visualisation/data.json
